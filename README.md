    * __Northeast__
    * __Southeast__
    * __Midwest__
    * __South__
    * __West__
* This analysis also __utilizes Prophet__ to __forecast category sales__ across __each region__.

## __Data Cleaning and Methodology__

* __Adidas Sales Data__: 
    * We used a __2020/2021 product sales dataset__: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heemalichaudhari/adidas-sales-dataset)
* __Temperature Data__: 
    * __Monthly temperature data__ by __state from 1950-2022__: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinrwong/average-monthly-temperature-by-us-state).
* __Data Cleaning__: We addressed __missing data__ and __inconsistencies__ in __both datasets__ to __ensure accurate analysis__. Such as: 
    * The __initial Total Product Sales__ data being __miscalculated__
    * __Most States/Regions__ were __missing 2021 Data__
    * __Minor Temperature increments__ caused __"Lumpy Data"__ in graphs
* __Correlation Analysis__: We calculated __correlation coefficients__ to __assess__ the __relationship__ between __temperature__ and __sales__ in __each region__.
